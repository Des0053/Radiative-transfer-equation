# Radiative-transfer-equation
Monochromatic beam interacts with particle population in 2 dimentions. Using Monte Carlo simulations the progam calculates the spacial and energy distribution of the exiting spectrum.

In Scattering_Absorption_3.py: The beam enters an electron population with power law energy distribution in limits [Emin,Emax]

In Scattering_Absorption_4.py: The beam enters an electron population with Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution in limits [Emin,Emax]

In Scattering_Absorption_Atoms.py: The beam enters a Hydrogen atom population with Boltzmann energy distribution and temperature T,partially ionized depnding on the value of T.

Also used for modelling Betelgeuse's great beaming as a mass injection phenomenon, estimating the mass injected.

Power_Law_prob.py and 2D_Max_prob.py: Generators of power law and MB energy distributions
